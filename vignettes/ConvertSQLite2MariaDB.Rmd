## Why convert from SQLite?

Perhaps you want to use a remote storage location multiple users can access the same data intead of each user having their own "silo" on their own laptop or desktop.  SQLite does not provide remote storage.

Take a look at this blog by Dean Attali:
[Persistent Data Storage](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html)

## Set up MariaDB

- Download the MariaDB installation software from:
https://go.mariadb.com/download-mariadb-server-community.html<br>
You should have `mariadb-10.5.4-winx64.msi` in your download folder

- Next, install (or get IT to install for you) the msi file you downloaded.
(Go into Biogen Access Management and Chat with IT)

- During installation, set up your root (admin) password and save it.
It will also ask you to choose a port number, the default being 3306.
If you already have MySQL running, you will need to choose another port number.

- Keep the MariaDB reference guide nearby:
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/documentation/

- Go into settings -> Services and check that MariaDB is running<br>

- Next, start the MariaDB command line client and create a database<br>
 ![](MariaDB_CLI.png)

- Now it's time to create a database. Note the name is case-sensitive.<br>
  type: `CREATE DATABASE mymariadatabase;` <br>
  on the command line.  Note the semicolon at the end.<br>
  and then type: `USE mymariadatabase;` <br>

- Create a user and grant privileges <br>
  type: `CREATE USER 'rkrajcik'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';`<br>
  type: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mymariadatabase.* TO 'rkrajcik'@'localhost';`

- Databases are created in "C:\\Program Files\\MariaDB 10.5\\data"

- To remove a database, type: `DROP DATABASE mymariadatabase;`

## Shiny Modifications.

- In R, type: `install.packages("RMariaDB")`

- In `setup.R`, replace `"RSQLite"` with `"RMariaDB"`
  And add package "glue" to the bottom of the list if it's not already there.

- Add add these two lines at the bottom of `setup.R`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(shiny.port = 1221)         # default port number for shiny
options(shiny.host = '127.0.0.1')  # use '127.0.0.1' for local access
```

In `utils.R` make the following changes:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Stores the database name.
# db_name <- "database.sql"

db_name <- "mymariadatabase"
db_user <- Sys.getenv("USERNAME")
# db_password <- "mysqlpassword"
db_password <- rstudioapi::askForPassword("Please enter your password")

db_host <- unlist(unname(options("shiny.host"))) 
db_port <- 3703  # port for MariaDB (3306 was used by MySQL)
```

Instead of hardcoding the MariaDB user password, I opted to ask for it the first time around and save it. Note the port number for MariaDB defaults to 3306, but I chose 3703 instead as MySQL was using 3306.

Now for some more changes.

in the `create_db()` function inside `utils.R` 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create a local database.
create_db <- function(){
  
  # Create an empty database.
  # con <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), db_name)
  
  con <-  dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), user = db_user,
                    password = db_password,
                    dbname = db_name, host = db_host, port = db_port)
  
  alltables = dbListTables(con)  # new line
  
  # create tables if there aren't any yet
  if (is_empty(alltables)) {     # new line
  
    message(glue::glue("No tables defined for {db_name}, Creating them now.")) # new line
    
    # Set the path to the queries.
    path <- file.path("Utils", "sql_queries")
    
    # Queries needed to run the first time the db is created.
    queries <- c(
      "create_Packageinfo_table.sql",
      "create_MaintenanceMetrics_table.sql",
      "create_CommunityUsageMetrics_table.sql",
      "create_TestMetrics_table.sql",
      "create_Comments_table.sql"
    )
    
    # Append path to the queries.
    queries <- file.path(path, queries)
    
    # Apply each query.
    sapply(queries, function(x){
      res <- dbSendStatement(
        con,
        paste(scan(x, sep = "\n", what = "character"), collapse = ""))
      
      dbClearResult(res)
    })
  } # New line -- if (is_empty(alltables))
  
  dbDisconnect(con)
}

```

Now change the code for the `db_fun()` and `db_ins()` functions like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
 # con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), db_name)
 
  con <-  dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), user = db_user, password = db_password,
                    dbname = db_name, host = db_host, port = db_port)
```

Again in Utils.R, the Timestamp created is completely non-standard.<br>
At least using Sys.time() resembles the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP provided in MySQL and MariaDB.
I found that a UTC time value was expected and modified as follows:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
TimeStamp<-function(){
  # Timestamp_intial<-str_replace(Sys.time()," ", "; ")
  # Timestamp<-paste(Timestamp_intial, Sys.timezone())
  # return(Timestamp)
  # use something MySQL is expecting to see...
  # as.character(Sys.time())
  lubridate::with_tz(Sys.time(), "UTC")  # lubridate is a tidyverse package
}
```
I was able to confirm by going back to the MariaDB Command Line Interface:
 ![](SelectFromComments.png)
 
Finally, update function `genInfo_upload_to_DB()` in `Modules\dbupload.R` as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
genInfo_upload_to_DB <- function(package_name, ver, title, desc, auth, main, lis, pub) {
  tryCatch(
    expr = {
      # db_ins(paste0( "INSERT or REPLACE INTO Packageinfo values(", "'", package_name, "',", "'", ver, "',", "'", title ,"'," , "'", desc, "',",
      #                "'", main, "',", "'", auth, "',", "'", lis, "',", "'", pub, "',", "'',", "''", ")"))
      db_ins(paste0( "INSERT INTO Packageinfo values(", "'", package_name, "',", "'", ver, "',", "'", title ,"'," , "'", desc, "',",
                     "'", main, "',", "'", auth, "',", "'", lis, "',", "'", pub, "',", "'',", "''", 
                     ") ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE package = ", "'", package_name, "'" ))
    },
    error = function(e) {
      loggit("ERROR", paste("Error in uploading the general info of the package", package_name, "info", e), app = "fileupload-DB")
    }
  )# End of try catch 

} # End of the function
```


## Setup the Tables

SQLite is very forgiving about specifying data types.  Not so with either MySQL or MariaDB.

The easiest way for me to guess what the Types and lengths were needed was to take the SQLite database created and dump it using the sqlite3 utility: `sqlite3 database.sqlite .dump > datadump`

This is what the SQL statements look like now in `Utils\sql_queries`
Note the `FOREIGN KEY` and `REFERENCES` have been removed.  I did not find them necessary.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Comments (   
comm_id      CHAR(20) NOT NULL,    
user_name 	 CHAR(40),   
user_role 	 CHAR(40),   
comment 		 VARCHAR(1000),   
comment_type CHAR(10),   
added_on 	 TIMESTAMP
); 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CommunityUsageMetrics (  
cum_id 					            CHAR(20) NOT NULL,   
no_of_downloads_last_year   INT,  
month 					            CHAR(20),  
no_of_downloads 			      INT,  
ver_release 				        CHAR(5),  
position					          INT,  
time_since_first_release    INT,  
time_since_version_release  INT   
); 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MaintenanceMetrics (   
mm_id   								             CHAR(20) NOT NULL,    
package_has_vignettes				         CHAR(5),   
package_has_news                     CHAR(5),   
news_is_current					             CHAR(10),   
package_has_website				           VARCHAR(200),   
has_bug_reports					             VARCHAR(200),   
has_a_package_maintainer			       VARCHAR(200),   
source_code_is_public   				     VARCHAR(100),   
exported_objects_with_documentation  VARCHAR(15),   
status_of_last_30_reported_bugs  	   CHAR(15) 
); 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Packageinfo(   
package        CHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,    
version        CHAR(10),   
title          VARCHAR(200),   
description    TEXT,   
maintainer     VARCHAR(200),   
author         VARCHAR(1000),   
license        CHAR(50),   
published_on   CHAR(15),   
score          CHAR(5),   
decision       CHAR(1)
); 

CREATE TABLE TestMetrics IF NOT EXISTS(   
tm_id 		    CHAR(20) NOT NULL,    
test_coverage CHAR(10)  
); 
```

Now run the app and build the tables!
